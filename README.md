# Qt Fragment Shader IDE
This is a simple GLSL fragment shader IDE that I'm writing in Qt (and thus, inherently, C++) and a bit of OpenGL, mostly for educational purposes.

## To do
- [ ] Add ability to manage .glsl files.
- [ ] Add ability to change fonts.
- [ ] Syntax highlighting.
- [x] Basic error checking.
- [ ] UI cleanup.
- [x] Implement ```time``` uniform.
- [x] Implement ```resolution``` uniform.
- [ ] Implement ```mouse``` uniform.
- [ ] Textures in vertex shader.
- [ ] ```Help``` section.
- [ ] Text formatting features.
- [x] Include all uniforms and attributes by default. (not visible to the user)

Doesn't quite work on Windows yet. Need to do more debugging.
